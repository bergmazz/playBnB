# About

Welcome to PlayBnB! As a parent myself, with a daughter who brings endless joy to my life, I'm passionate about finding exciting and imaginative play experiences for her. Initially, I set out to create a clone of Airbnb. As I was brainstorming, hoping to come up with some creative (and silly) seed data, I decided to cater specifically to kid's play spots. So, here's my spin on the vacation rental giant- a site designed exclusively for kid's play!

This platform aspires to connect parents and caregivers with a wide range of kid-friendly play-themed spots. Whether it's a whimsical indoor playroom filled with colorful toys, a magical outdoor playground with interactive installations, or a themed adventure center where little ones can embark on thrilling quests, you'll find an array of delightful options to choose from. 

I'm a firm believer in regularly creating experiences that are imaginative, immersive, and memorable- and vacations are the perfect time to catch up on magic-making when life gets too busy! That's why I've imagined up a collection of play spots that encompass a variety of themes, allowing children to step into enchanting worlds, unleash their creativity, and make unforgettable memories. It should be easier for families to find and book these extraordinary play destinations. 

With PlayBnB, a new adventure for the whole family is just a few clicks away.
